## How to Run Program

- Will add more steps later 

## Summary of Project
Our project aims to help users find all the garbage disposal locations near them. They would open the app on their phones to see on the maps to find the nearest one.
We plan on having every user have an account for this application.


## Functional Goals
- Have every user be able to sign in to an account
  - Each account would have some form of stats of how much they either threw away, or recycled.
- Each user could navigate around the map and see for any garbage disposal locations near them in realtime.

## UI/FrontEnd/Backend Goals

# FrontEnd
  - Use Flutter with Dart or Javascript to make the design of the project
  - Also use Google Maps API, perhaps Geolocation or general map API for the user to be able to use and navigate around.
# UI
  - Use Glass marker style for transparency for user viewing satisfaction
# BackEnd
  - Use SQLite as our backend technology to keep track of custom locations of garbage locations.


## Issues
- Auto Layout could be an issue
